	We are developing a Student's Information Management System using C & C++ programming languages.
	Some basic operations that we can do in this system are:
		->Add new student's information
		->Search specific student's information by ID no.
		->View all student's information
		->Edit/Update any student's information
		->Delete a single student's information by ID no.
		->Delete all Student's information.
		->You can also restore deleted student's information from Recycle Bin

	We are implementing Student's information in student type structured data and storing it by Linked List.
	Storing data
		->Student ID
		->Name
		->Phone
		->E-mail
		->Enrolled Courses
			->Course Code
			->Course Name
			Storing course information in map(C++ STL Property) where Course Code is the key and course name is the value
